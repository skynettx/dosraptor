# DOS Raptor
This is the original Raptor Call Of The Shadows DOS source code v1.2 with the Apogee Sound System and the
DMX wrapper APODMX instead of the proprietary DMX library.

## Build
To build all libraries and the exe under DOS use Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1.
For a build that more closely matches the original exe file v1.2 (without DMX library) you will need the following:
```
AUDIOLIB: Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1
APODMX: A compatible version of Watcom C32 
GFX: Watcom C 9.5b and TASM 3.1
SOURCE: Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1
```
